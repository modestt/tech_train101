MSP430 Project #1 - Learn how to interface and program GPIO pins using bitwise operations on the MSP430 microcontroller in this complete project-based guide.
 I have covered relay control, push button input, and coding examples to help you get started with real-world applications. 
Learn how to control higher Power devices by MSP430 series microcontroller. This specific microcontroller project demonstrates how to control a 20W LED floodlight by MSP430G2231, using Relay and push button Switch. 
Learn Core Concepts such as what are Active High and Active Low digital signals, bitwise operations, what is a Pull Up and Pull down. 
Complete with schematics for relay and push button connections to digital I/O, with Code Composer IDE and MSP430G2231 microcontroller, MSP-EXP430G2ET Launchpad. 
I shall be configuring Digital IO port registers and use Bit masking programming techniques to handle the digital input and output Pins.
 I shall be particularly focusing on Low level digital hardware interface and how to program effective embedded C code for low level hardware control.
